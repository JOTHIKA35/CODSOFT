        <p>
            Detecting drowning accidents accurately and immediately is essential to
            saving lives because drowning is a major cause of unintentional death
            worldwide. Through the use of You Only Look Once (YOLO) and image and
            video input, we suggest a method in this research for the detection of multiple
            drowning persons. A deep learning model called YOLO is suited for processing
            image data since it is made to recognize temporal connections in sequential data.
            In order to capture the drowning incidents, our suggested system employs
            image/video data taken from cameras placed under water sources. For the YOLO
            model to effectively identify the presence of numerous drowning victims, the
            image data is pre-processed. The results show that the suggested approach is
            effective at reliably detecting numerous drowning persons and trigger an alarm
            to alert the lifeguards to save the drowning persons. We tested our proposed
            system using a dataset of simulated drowning incidents. Our suggested technique
            has the potential to be applied in practical situations to enhance the speed and
            precision of drowning detection, which could save many lives.
