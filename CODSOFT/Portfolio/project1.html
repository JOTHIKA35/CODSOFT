    <h1>Online Car rental system</h1>
</div>
    <div class="content">
    <p>A car rental is a vehicle that can be used temporarily for a fee for a certain period
        of time. The customer/user who needs a car should contact the rental company and rent a car. The
        staff of that car rental company also need to check their data to see whether the car is available or
        not for rental on that time. This online car rental system project is to book/reserve a car for a rent
        from anywhere where they are, so that customers do not need to call and spent unnecessary time
        to reserve a car. They can go online and reserve the car they want that are available. Customers
        and company will also able to track the car where it is. The project's goal is to automate car rental
        and reservation so that clients don't have to waste time calling and waiting for a vehicle. To convert
        the manual car rental procedure into a digital method.</p>
